# Identifying Key Drivers of Home Loan Approvals Using Power BI

- This project focuses on analyzing the key drivers influencing home loan approvals for amounts exceeding â‚¹10 Lakh. Using Power BI, we explore applicant demographics, financial status, and credit history to uncover the factors that significantly impact loan approvals and repayment risks.

# Dataset Overview

- The dataset includes applicant information across three broad categories:

- Applicant Demographics: Gender, marital status, number of dependents, education.

- Financial Information: Applicant & co-applicant income, loan amount, loan term, property area.

- Credit & Loan History: Credit score, previous loan history, repayment behavior.

# Project Goals

## Understand Key Influences

- Identify the primary factors impacting approval of loan amounts exceeding â‚¹10 Lakh.

## Visualize Insights

- Build interactive Power BI dashboards to analyze loan patterns and applicant profiles.

## Enhance Loan Approval Strategies

- Provide data-driven recommendations to improve loan decision-making and reduce risks associated with high-value loans.

# Key Insights from the Analysis
1. Loan Amount vs Income

- Strong positive correlation between applicant income and loan amount.

- Co-applicant income boosts eligibility for larger loans.

2. Impact of Credit History

- Applicants with a credit score â‰¥ 700 are more likely to secure loans above â‚¹10 Lakh.

- Poor credit history leads to higher rejection rates or smaller approvals.

3. Loan Approval by Property Area

- Urban applicants dominate high-value loan approvals.

- Semi-urban & rural applicants show lower success rates, indicating an opportunity for market expansion.

4. Influence of Marital & Dependent Status

- Married applicants with fewer dependents are more likely to secure high-value loans.

- Single applicants often qualify for smaller amounts due to perceived higher financial risk.

5. Loan Term & Repayment Behavior

- Longer loan terms increase chances of higher loan approval.

- However, default rates are higher in long-term loans, signaling repayment risks.
